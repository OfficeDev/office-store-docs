# Prepare localized solutions

To offer your app solution in languages beyond the primary language, you need localized metadata for each additional language. For apps, the best customer experience is to provide web services and functionality that support these additional languages. You also need to create descriptions in each language. For a list of the languages that Partner Center currently accepts, see the table later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about localizing add-ins, see [Localization for Office Add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/localization) and [Localize SharePoint Add-ins](/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/localize-sharepoint-add-ins). 

To distribute your solution in additional languages, choose **Manage additional languages** on the **Marketplace listings** page in Partner Center. After you add other languages, you need to submit your solution for certification again. 

For previously approved apps, if you updated your manifest, you need to ensure that you update the app version in the manifest. The current app version remains in Microsoft AppSource and the in-product experience until your new app is approved, unless you unpublish the current app. 

## Localized Microsoft AppSource fronts

Microsoft AppSource is available in 40 languages in 60 corresponding markets. In each of these markets, Microsoft AppSource displays metadata in either English or the corresponding language. When you submit your solution, you can provide metadata (descriptions, screen shots, name) in the languages that you would like to be listed in, and explicitly specify these languages on the **Marketplace listings** page in Partner Center. Verify that the primary submission language is in the app manifest, if applicable. 

If English is the only submission language, by default, your solution is listed in Microsoft AppSource fronts in all 60 markets with English metadata. 

If a non-English language is the submission language, your solution is listed in Microsoft AppSource fronts in the corresponding markets, with metadata in that language. 

If English and any other non-English language are submission languages, the solution is listed in all 60 markets with English metadata, except for those markets for which the corresponding non-English language has been submitted, where the metadata is in the corresponding language.

The following table lists the submission languages that Microsoft AppSource is available in, and the locales and markets that correspond to each of these languages.
