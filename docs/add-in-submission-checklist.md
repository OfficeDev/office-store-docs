## Step 7: For each language your add-in is available in, create your detailed store listing copy, icons, videos and screenshots

Within the language option, you'll find where you can fill in your add-in's store listing information, such as your add-in description and images.

## Step 8: Set your availability date and time for when you want your add-in listing to appear

Note it typically takes 4 to 6 weeks to complete an app submission and get it approved. On average, most add-ins require multiple submissions to pass our validation process, so follow our checklist carefully to reduce this time.

## Step 9:  Make sure you add your critical testing instructions

This final critical step requires you include notes for certification, This is any critical instructions for the reviewer who will be testing your add-in, including test accounts, license keys and testing credentials.

If you checked the box stating you require additional purchases, make sure you provide any information such as license keys that a review might need to evaluate your add-in.

>[!TIP]
> Do not include an email address of a company employee who can provide log-in information. Our reviewers will be able to  email you for log-in information. Applications that include an email instead of certification notes will fail the submission process automatically.

The following image shows the Notes for certification box where you must provide information.
