# Reserve a name for your solution

To create a submission in Partner Center, the first step is to reserve a name. This is typically the name displayed in the marketplace for the language of your choosing. You can reserve multiple names, at least one for each localized marketplace listing you plan to create. Names must be unique throughout the Office catalog.

We recommend that you reserve a name for your solution even if you haven't developed it yet, so that another developer doesn't use your name. Note, however, that you'll need to submit your solution within three months in order to keep the name that you reserved.

## Reserve your solution name

1.  From the **Overview** page, select **Create a new...**.
2.  In the text box, enter the name that you want to use, and then select **Check availability**. 
    If the name is available, you'll see a green check mark. 
    If the name you entered is already reserved or in use by another developer, you'll see a message that the name is not available.
3.  Select **Reserve product name**.

The name is now reserved for you, and you can start working on your submission whenever you're ready. 

We recommend that you limit your name to 30-50 characters, and include the important keywords in the first 30 characters.

For guidelines for solution names, see [Use a succinct and descriptive name](create-effective-office-store-listings.md#use-a-succinct-and-descriptive-name).

> [!NOTE]
> You might find that you can't reserve a name, even though you don't see any apps listed by that name in Microsoft AppSource. This is usually because another developer has reserved the name but hasn't submitted it yet. If you're unable to reserve a name for which you hold the trademark or other legal right, or if you see another app in Microsoft AppSource using that name, [contact Microsoft](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=233777).

After you reserve a name, you have three months to submit your solution. If you don't submit it within three months, the name reservation will expire, and another developer can use that name. You might encounter an error if you try to submit a solution with a name that has expired.

## Choose product display name

If you reserve more than one name for your product, you can specify which name you want to use for the display name in Partner Center. In the **Names for this product** list, choose **Set as dashboard name** in the Actions column next to the reserved name that you would like to use for the display name.
