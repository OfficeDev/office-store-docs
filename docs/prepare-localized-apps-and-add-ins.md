# Prepare localized apps and add-ins

To offer your Office Add-in, SharePoint Add-in, or Office 365 app in languages beyond the primary language, you need localized metadata for each additional language. The best customer experience is with apps or add-ins that have web services and functionality that support these additional languages. You also need to create descriptions in each language. For a list of the languages that the Seller Dashboard currently accepts, see Table 2 later in this article.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about localizing add-ins, see [Localization for Office Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/localization) and [Localize SharePoint Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/localize-sharepoint-add-ins). 

To distribute your app or add-in in additional languages, you can edit the details in the Seller Dashboard. After you add other languages, you need to submit it for approval again. 

In the case of previously approved add-ins, if you updated your manifest, you need to ensure that you update the add-in version in the manifest and in the submission form. The current add-in version remains in AppSource and the in-product Store until your new add-in is approved, unless you unpublish the current add-in. For more information, see [Update, unpublish, and view metrics in the Seller Dashboard](update-unpublish-and-view-metrics.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> You can block customers in a certain country/region from acquiring or using your app or add-in when you add or edit it in the Seller Dashboard.

## Localized AppSource fronts

AppSource is available in 40 languages in 60 corresponding markets, as listed in Table 2. In each of these markets, AppSource displays metadata in either English or the corresponding language. When you submit an app or add-in, you can provide metadata (descriptions, screen shots, title) in the languages that you would like to be listed in, and explicitly specify these languages as submission languages in the Seller Dashboard. Verify that the primary submission language is in the add-in manifest, if applicable. 

If English is the only submission language, by default, your app or add-in is listed in AppSource fronts in all 60 markets with English metadata. 

If any of the non-English languages is a submission language, your app or add-in is listed in AppSource fronts in the corresponding markets, with metadata in that language. 

If English and any of the other non-English languages are submission languages, the app or add-in is listed in all 60 markets with English metadata, except for those markets for which the corresponding non-English language has been submitted, where the metadata is in the corresponding language.

In the Seller Dashboard, you can explicitly block markets in which to distribute your app or add-in. 

Users can verify whether a market-specific AppSource front is available for a market by selecting that market in the upper-right of the AppSource page, as shown in Figure 1. From there, users either are directed to the market-specific store front, or if that store front is not available, see a message that suggests that they go to AppSource in the United States.

The following table lists the submission languages that AppSource is available in, and the locales and markets that correspond to each of these languages. For a list of all the languages and locales for which you can localize an app or add-in, see [Language identifiers and OptionState Id values in Office 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179219%28Office.15%29.aspx).
