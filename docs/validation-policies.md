Microsoft Teams apps that depend on authentication to an external service to allow content sharing in channels must clearly state in their help documentation (or similar location) how a user can disconnect or unshare any shared content (if the same feature is supported on the external service). The ability to unshare this content does not have to be present in the Microsoft Teams app, but the process should be clearly documented and the documentation should be accessible from within the app.|
|14.18| To help to ensure the security of your app and users, domains outside of your ogranization's control (including wildcards) and tunneling services cannot be included in the valid domains in your manifest.
