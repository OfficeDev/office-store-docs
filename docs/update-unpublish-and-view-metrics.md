# Update, unpublish, and view metrics in the Seller Dashboard

After you submit your solution to the Seller Dashboard, you might want to update them or remove (unpublish) them from AppSource listings. You can also delete your submissions from the Seller Dashboard. You can use metrics in the Seller Dashboard to evaluate how your solutions are performing.
