# Specify availability for your Office solution

You can define the markets in which your solution will be available, and schedule the date on which your solution will be discoverable, on the Availability page in Partner Center.

> [!NOTE] 
> Pricing model management is not supported for Office marketplace products. Existing paid products that migrated from Seller Dashboard will need to move to a SaaS model or be made free by July 2020. You can monetize your add-in through the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace; for details, see [Monetize your add-in](monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace.md). 

## Markets

By default, your solution will be available in all markets, including any future markets that are added later. If you don't want your solution to be available in some countries/regions, you can select the markets in which your solution will be available. Choose **Show options** and uncheck the check box next to the market or markets in which you don't want your solution to be available. You can also **Unselect all** markets and then select markets individually.

If you don't want your solution to automatically be made available in future markets, uncheck the **Make my product available in any future market at the base price and general availability date** check box.

> [!NOTE]
> To submit a SharePoint Add-in that uses OAuth and that you want to distribute to China, you must select China only.

## Schedule

By default, your solution will be made available and discoverable in Microsoft AppSource as soon as possible. If you want to schedule the day and time on which your solution will be discoverable in Microsoft AppSource, use the date and time selectors to specify the date and time at which your solution will be discoverable to customers. 

<!--Note that your solution will still be accessible via direct link in Microsoft AppSource prior to the release date.-->
<!--
If you choose not to make your solution discoverable in Microsoft AppSource, select the **Make my product hidden after release and accessible only by direct link** check box.
-->
<!--

> If youâ€™re submitting a freemium app or an add-in that requires the purchase of an additional external service, see the **Associated service purchase** option on the **Add-in setup** page.
