# Ratings and reviews dashboard for office add-in analytics

This article provides information on the _Ratings and reviews_ dashboard in Partner Center for Office add-ins. This dashboard displays a consolidated view of customer feedback for selected office add-ins. As customers browse, search, and purchase offers, they can leave ratings and reviews for the offers they've acquired.

- Customers can submit a new rating or review and update or delete an existing rating or review they have submitted. Customers can make changes only to the ratings and reviews they own.
- Reviews are posted on the **Reviews** tab of the product display page of the offer in Microsoft AppSource. Customers can include their name or post anonymously.

## Accessing the Ratings & reviews dashboard

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
1. If you see the **Workspaces** toggle in the top menu bar, make sure the toggle is set to on.

## Review comments

The default view displays all reviews, and you can filter through the reviews by star rating using the **rating filter** in the dropdown menu.

### Respond to a review
