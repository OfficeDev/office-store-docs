# Upload your package to Microsoft AppSource

On the **Packages** page in Partner Center, drag or select your manifest file or app package to upload it.

To remove or replace your app package, choose **Remove** in the **Action** column.

When you upload your package, you might get one of the following messages:

- **Manifest errors**. If your manifest contains errors, Partner Center reports those errors and you have to resolve them before you can submit your solution.
- **Applications and platforms supported**. Office Add-in host applications and platforms are specified in the **Requirements** element in your manifest. Your solution will be validated against all the applications and platforms listed. For more information, see [Office Add-in host and platform availability](/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-in-availability).
