# Open a developer account in Partner Center

To publish your Office solutions to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), you first need to set up a developer account. You sign up for a developer account using your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work account.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing Microsoft account that you used to sign in to Seller Dashboard, that account will continue to work in Partner Center.

Depending on your scenario, you might be able to use an existing Partner Center developer account. The following table lists the possible developer account scenarios.

|**Scenario**|**Developer account options**|
|:-----------|:-----------------|
|No existing Partner Center program registrations.|Sign up for a new account using your work or school account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your work or school account.|Reuse your existing account or choose to create a new account.|
|Registered for another Partner Center program with your Microsoft account.|Associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account or keep your existing Office developer account.|
|Registered as an Office developer with your Microsoft account and you want to register for the Commercial Marketplace program.|Choose to associate your Azure AD work or school account with your existing seller account, or sign up for the Commercial Marketplace program with your work or school account and reuse your existing seller account.|

## Before you begin

To create an Office developer account on Partner Center, make sure that you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

## Create your developer account
You can create an account in one of two ways:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Network Account, [create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, [create an account directly from Partner Center using existing Microsoft Partner Center enrollments](#create-an-account-using-an-existing-partner-center-enrollment).

### Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page
If you're new to Partner Center, follow the instructions in this section to create your account. 

1. Go to the [Partner Center enrollment](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/office) page.
2. Sign in with a work account so you so that you can link your company's work email account domain to your new Partner Center account. By associating these accounts, your company employees can sign in to Partner Center with their work account user names and passwords.

  > [!NOTE]
  > To determine whether your company already has a work account and for information about how to create a new work account or set up multiple work accounts to use with Partner Center, see [Your company work account and Partner Center](/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/company-work-accounts).

3. Provide your publisher profile. Your publisher profile includes your company info, publisher info, and contact info.
4. After you've confirmed your publisher profile information, agree to the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Office Agreement and select **Accept and continue** to create your Partner Center account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.

If your tenant already has an existing enrollment in Partner Center, you will see a list of accounts in the dropdown to choose from. Select an account, and your Office enrollment will be associated with the same accounts.

### Create an account using an existing Partner Center enrollment
If you already have an enrollment in Partner Center, to create your account:

- Sign in to Partner Center using your existing credentials.
- Cick the gear icon, and then choose **Account settings** > **Programs**.
- On the Your Programs page, in the Office Store tile, choose **Get Started**.
- Complete the details on the publisher profile page.
- Read the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Office Store Agreement, and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

#### Enrolled in a developer program
If you're already enrolled in a Partner Center developer program, create your account directly from Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
> To sign up for the Office Store under the same account you're signed in as, you need to have registered on Partner Center using a company account. If you signed up with an individual account, your Office Store enrollment will appear under a new account.
> Individual accounts are for single developers working on their own. Company accounts are for organizations and businesses. Company accounts give you access to submit apps with additional functionality. We require greater verification for company accounts after you register to confirm that you're authorized to set up the account for your company. This verification can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company. Both types of accounts allow you to submit apps, add-ins, and services. For more info, see Account types, locations, and fees.

Sign in to Partner Center with your Partner Center account to enroll into the Office Store program under the same account. By signing up for Office Store using the same account, you can see both your existing program enrollments and Office Store in the left navigation menu of Partner Center.

After you sign in, use the following steps to finish setting up your account:

- From Partner Center, select **Settings** > **Account Settings** > **Programs** > **Get Started**, and enter your work email address.
- Complete the details on the publisher profile page.
- Read the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Office Store Agreement, and then select **Accept and continue** to complete your enrollment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be authorized to act on your company's behalf in order to accept these terms.
